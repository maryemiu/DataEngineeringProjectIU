"""
Pydantic response models for the Recommendation API.

Privacy NFR: returns IDs + score only.
  - No names, emails, or raw interaction data ever leave this API.
  - 'user_id' and 'recommended_user_id' are anonymized EdNet identifiers.

Governance NFR: 'generation_date' always present so consumers know data freshness.
