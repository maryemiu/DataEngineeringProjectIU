"""
Recommendation API — FastAPI application factory.

Responsibilities:
  - Lifespan: opens / closes the asyncpg connection pool on startup / shutdown
  - Mounts versioned routers: /v1/recommendations, /health
  - CORS: disabled in production (traffic comes from internal network only)

Design rules followed:
  - No business logic here — only wiring
  - One responsibility: app assembly
