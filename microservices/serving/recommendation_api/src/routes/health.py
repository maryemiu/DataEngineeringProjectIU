"""
GET /health — liveness and readiness probe.

Reliability NFR:
  - Never returns HTTP 5xx — always HTTP 200 regardless of DB state.
  - If DB is unavailable the status is "degraded" (not "error") so
    the load balancer / Docker healthcheck can still distinguish
    startup from a genuine outage.
  - No JWT required — must be reachable before auth is set up.

Used by:
  - Docker HEALTHCHECK in the Dockerfile
  - Orchestration layer compose depends_on healthcheck
