# Root Docker Compose — wires all service groups together.
# Requires Docker Compose v2.20+
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. Create the shared network once:
#      docker network create uni_net
#
#   2. Copy .env.example → .env and fill in secrets before running.
#
# To start all long-running services:
#   docker compose up -d
#
# The ingestion, processing, and recommendation_loader services are NOT
# started here — they are triggered by the scheduler scripts only.
